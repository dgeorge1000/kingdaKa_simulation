# kingdaKa_simulation
Created a simulation to model the queue for the world's fastest roller coaster, Kingda Ka. The team researched data about the attendance of the coaster at different times during the day, the capacity the coaster can take per ride, and how many rides occur in one day. After producing various models, our final model recorded vital data such as average queue time and max queue time that was within 5% error of the expect values.
